## About Root

Root is a next-generation social communication platform with an integrated App Store. It allows users to create and join communities, and connect with others through text, voice, video, screen sharing, and file sharing.

Developers can build full GUI apps that run directly inside communities. Community leaders install Apps and Bots to design spaces tailored to their members. Apps integrate seamlessly with Root’s features, including roles and permissions, giving moderators full control and ensuring data security.
